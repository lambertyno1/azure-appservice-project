# ☁️ DevOps Ticket Booking System

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/lambertyno1/azure-appservice-project/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lambertyno1/azure-appservice-project/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

## 📖 Project Overview

Welcome to the **DevOps Ticket Booking System**. 

While this repository contains a fully functional web application for browsing events, booking tickets, and managing an admin dashboard, **the application is merely the vehicle**. The true focus of this project is the **engine**: a production-ready, automated Cloud and DevOps lifecycle. 

This project demonstrates the ability to design, secure, automate, deploy, monitor, and maintain a cloud-native application using industry-standard practices, including containerization, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code principles, and zero-downtime deployment strategies.

## ✨ Key Features

### Application Features
- **User Authentication**: Role-based login (User vs. Admin) with mock JWT token generation.
- **RESTful API**: Clean, documented endpoints for fetching events and creating bookings.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: A responsive, single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure, token-protected view of all database bookings.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Logic to ensure a single email cannot book the same event twice.

### DevOps & Cloud Features
- **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys on every merge to `main`.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized application ensuring 100% environment consistency.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Utilizes Azure App Service Deployment Slots (Staging → Production swap).
- **Quality Gates**: Automated `/health` endpoint checks before promoting code to production.
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Zero hardcoded credentials. All secrets are managed via GitHub Secrets and Azure Application Settings.
- **Observability**: Integrated Azure Log Stream and Application Logging for real-time troubleshooting.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern, decoupled architecture:
1. **Client**: Browser-based frontend communicating via REST API.
2. **Server**: Node.js/Express backend handling business logic and authentication.
3. **Database**: A dedicated integration layer (`app/database.js`). *(Note: For demonstration reliability, this uses an in-memory mock store structured identically to a real Azure PostgreSQL database).*
4. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Hosted on Microsoft Azure (App Service + Container Registry).
